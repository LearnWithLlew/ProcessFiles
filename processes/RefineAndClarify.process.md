## Description

This process helps go over a document to structure it, clarify it and find potential pitfalls.

## Steps

### Step 1: Read the Document
Read the document you are refining thoroughly to understand its content, purpose, and current structure.

### Step 2: Ask Clarifying Questions
Identify and ask questions about anything you find confusing or conflicting in the document. Surface these issues one at a time.

### Step 3: Look for Missing Elements
Review the document to identify any missing information, steps, or details that would improve completeness or clarity.

### Step 4: Restructure the Document
Reorganize the content for better flow and comprehension. Add mermaid diagrams only if they would genuinely help clarify complex relationships or processes.

### Step 5: Make It Concise
Remove unnecessary content, wordiness, and redundancy. Keep the document as concise as possible while maintaining clarity and completeness.
