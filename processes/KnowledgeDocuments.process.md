# Knowledge Documents

The goal of this document is to help people create knowledge documents.

This can be executed in 2 different ways:

1. At the end of a chat.
2. As the first prompt in the chat.

## Process

### If this is at the end of a chat

1. Review the chat and treat it as the source material.
2. Extract the process being described.
3. If the intended process is unclear, offer a few options for what knowledge document to extract.
4. Have the user select one of the options, or choose another.

Examples of options:

- How to make a startup page.
- How to create a page.
- How to use a specific tool that was used while making the page.

### If this is at the beginning of the chat

1. Ask: "What is this document about?"

## Output format

1. Create a small knowledge document.
2. At the very top, include a bullet list of the key pieces.
3. The bullet list can include:
   - File locations.
   - Prime directives.
   - Overall goals.
   - Process Steps
4. Add details underneath only if they are necessary.
5. If the bullet list plus the context of the project is enough, do not add more.

## Naming

If it is a process document, it should take the form `tool.process.md` or `process.process.md` (for example, `myprocess.process.md`).

If it is a context document, it should take the form `mycontext.md`.

Suggest a handful of short words (2 to 3 words at most) to create the document name.

At the end, suggest the best document name you can think of.
