# Daily Status Goals

## Purpose

The daily status is a short update for stakeholders that highlights what will be different after the coaching ends.
It is not a session log.

## Core Principles

**Focus on lasting change:**
- New patterns teams are adopting
- New habits forming
- New capabilities they now have
- Changes in how they work

**Keep it short:**
- Two hours of work should not produce a long read
- Stakeholders are busy - respect their time

**Positive framing for a wide audience:**
- This goes to managers and team members across the organization
- Be complimentary - don't imply people didn't know what they were doing
- Avoid internal jargon or negative framing (e.g., "bureaucracy")
- Frame outcomes as improvements, not problems being fixed

**Future outcomes as hopes, not facts:**
- When describing expected or hoped-for results, use belief language ("I'm hoping", "My goal is")
- Don't state future outcomes as certainties
- Example: "More people will use it" → "I'm hoping more people will be motivated to use it"

**Example reframes:**
- "Using it poorly" → "They can now use it to help them when they want"
- "Push through bureaucracy" → "Do the necessary work to get it on their machines"
- "The spec was incomplete" → "The AI's questions helped surface details to clarify"
- "This is generating interest" → "I'm hoping this sparked some interest"

## What to Include

- Patterns and practices teams are now using
- Mindset shifts observed
- Tools and capabilities now available to them
- What they'll continue doing after coaching ends

## What to Minimize

- Detailed play-by-play of session activities
- Technical artifacts (unless they illustrate a key point briefly)
- Internal coaching observations not relevant to stakeholders
