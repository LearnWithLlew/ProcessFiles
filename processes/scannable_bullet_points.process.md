# How to make scannable bullet points

## Three Key Principles

1. **Category label upfront:** Start with a bolded label that tells readers what the bullet is about
2. **Key terms bolded:** Highlight the essential concepts that convey meaning when skimming
3. **Reduced cognitive load:** Remove unnecessary qualifiers and simplify structure to be more direct

## Pattern
